# Eti's Logger
A C# logging library focused on intermediate support of colors and formatting garbage.

# Purpose
*Eti's Logger* is a (relatively) simple logging library designed for (mostly) output-agnostic support. It has the capability to output VT codes, but also has an arbitrary log component format that can be used to write colored logs to other output sources, such as a custom console window.

It's a bit spaghetti, as I wrote it for my own use case, but overall it *should* work out for general purpose stuffs.
